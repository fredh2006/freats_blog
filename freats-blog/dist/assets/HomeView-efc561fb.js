Thin. Deep-Dish. Stuffed? No, I’m not talking about women. I’m talking about pizza! While I’m far from what many would call a pizza connoisseur, I definitely do enjoy a slice from time to time. Now, everyone knows that pizzas have a near-unlimited amount of customization, whether it’s the variety of toppings, the crust, or even the way it’s cut. The crust, in my opinion, is the most integral part of the pizza. Its role as the foundation is essential to the success and tastiness of the slice. Everyone has different opinions when it comes to pizza crusts, but I’m not here to argue for one crust in particular (thin crust ftw). I’m here to enjoy and appreciate all the different types of crust.

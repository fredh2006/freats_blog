I’m Fred He, and I’m currently a grade 12 student. When I’m not stressing over school or studying for tests, you can find me in the kitchen, stuffing my face with whatever I can find. Throughout the entirety of my life, food has been an utmost importance to me, as it’s not only delicious and mouth-watering, but acts as a way for me to connect with my culture. This, in combination with an interest in computer science led me to create this blog. I love eating, and hope that I’ll be able to document lots of my journey to share with everyone through FREATS. </h1></div></div><div class="container right-about column"><img src="'+s+'" class="about-image"></div></div>',1),f={__name:"AboutView",setup(r){return(u,m)=>(e(),o("div",i,[a(t),c]))}};export{f as default};
